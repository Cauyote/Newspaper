  <p>After the battle between the French and German forces, a French infantryman reported locating a totem like structure with similar engravings to the figurine found in Dunwich, England. Standing roughly nine feet tall, this statue seems to cause nearby soldiers paranoia and light headaches.

        <h3> Germans siding  with cultist following!</h3>
        <p>Reports say that German forces are allying with the cultists in order to increase their power. British troops have encountered these men and say “They have no soul left in them, just  a carcass out for bloodshed.” Other reports say that in order to defeat such a horrible creature, you must hit em’ where it hurts, right between the eyes! If Germany wasn’t powerful enough with their skilled infantry,  they now have unholy warriors to aid them, watch out!

  <p>Recent reports inform us of a crazed cultist who summoned a massive wave of elder god spawns. At the same time a nearby squad of British infantry was assigned to find and kill this crazed man, sources say. Suddenly the unknown beings began to engage the British forces, utterly annihilating them.

    <p>A group of specialists that have prepared themselves for this type of event have joined the ranks of U.S. troops in aiding them not only against the Germans but also this cult following spreading all across Europe! They bear weapons of odd mechanisms like the “Tesla Cannon” which has the capability to shoot lightning from the conductors at the base of the rifle! This oddity is one of many weapons used to evaporate the enemy in order to protect the lands we know.
